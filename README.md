### Hi! I am Caleb Aguilar :notes:

I am a formerly pure mathematician from Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico. I love to work in communication / divulgation of science, so my bachelor thesis is written in a way that everyone could read and understand it by easy examples. Was written in Spanish and you can download it as pdf in this link: http://132.248.9.195/ptd2021/junio/0813173/Index.html

Recently I fall in love with the Data Science world and related topics as Natural Language Processing. So here you are going to see a little of my work in that way.

I discovered in February of 2021 that I have OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) however I have a good style of life. I specially love to meet new people with disorders or diseases and treat everyone with respect.
